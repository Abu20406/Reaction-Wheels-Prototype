The idea was to try and demonstrate a self balancing system. Although crude, the implementation was sufficient to show the principles of self balancing systems. The principle of conservation of angular momentum is the key concept for such systems. The potential applications include space satellite usage. Satellites could use one of these systems instead of using traditional thrusters to rotate and align to a specfic target. This would reduce weight and also increase efficiency. Could also be used in self asssemnbling systems as shown in this YouTube video - 


Our implementation was not perfect since we had some torque from the connecting wires due to which the angular momentum was continously disturbed. Floor friction also played a part
